    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <h3>The City of Los Angeles Privacy Policy was updated on March 5, 2015.</h3>
    <p>
      The purpose of this statement is to define the City of Los Angeles' policy with
      regards to the collection and use of personally identifiable information (PII
      - any information relating to an identified or identifiable individual who is
      the subject of the information).
    </p>
    <h1>Information Collected:</h1>
    <p>
      The City of Los Angeles collects two kinds of user information â€“ Anonymous Information
      and Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
    </p>
    <h1>Anonymous information is</h1>
    <p>
      information that does not identify specific individuals and is automatically
      transmitted by your browser. This information can consist of:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The URL (Uniform Resource Locator or address) of the web page you previously
        visited
      </li>
      <li>
        The domain names and/or IP addresses which are numbers that are automatically
        assigned to your computer whenever you are connected to the Internet or World
        Wide Web
      </li>
      <li>
        The browser version you are using to access the site
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This information is used to help improve our website. None of the information
      can be linked to any individual.
    </p>
    <h1>Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is </h1>
    <p>
      information that could include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Name
      </li>
      <li>
        Address
      </li>
      <li>
        Email address
      </li>
      <li>
        Telephone number
      </li>
      <li>
        Credit/debit card information
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The City will make every reasonable effort to protect your privacy. It restricts
      access to your personal identifiable information to those employees that will
      respond to your request. The City does not intentionally disclose any personal
      information about our users to any third parties inside or outside the City
      except as required by law.
    </p>
    <p>
      The City only collects personally identifiable information that is required
      to provide service. You can decline to provide us with any personal information
      on any site on the Internet at any time. However, if you should choose to withhold
      requested information, we may not be able to provide you with the online services
      dependent upon the collection of that information.
    </p>
    <h1>Access to Personally Identifiable Information</h1>
    <p>
      Access to personally identifiable information in public records at state and local
      levels of government in Los Angeles is controlled primarily by the California
      Public Records Act (Government Code Section 6250, et seq.). Information that
      is generally available under the Public Records Act may be posted for electronic
      access through the City's website. While the Public Records Act sets the general
      policies for access to City records, other sections of California code as well
      as federal laws also deal with confidentiality issues.
    </p>
    <h1>E-mail Addresses</h1>
    <p>
      E-mail addresses obtained through the website will not be sold or given to
      other private companies for marketing purposes. The information collected is
      subject to the access and confidentiality provisions of the Public Records Act,
      other applicable sections of the California code as well as federal laws. E-mail
      or other information requests sent to the City website may be maintained in
      order to respond to the request, forward that request to the appropriate agency
      within the City, communicate updates to the City page that may be of interest
      to citizens, or to provide the City web designer with valuable customer feedback
      to assist in improving the site. Individuals can cancel any communications regarding
      new service updates at any time.
    </p>
    <h1>Cookies</h1>
    <p>
      Some City applications use "cookies." A cookie is a small data file that certain
      websites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain
      information such as a user id that the site uses to track the pages you have
      visited. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information
      you supply yourself. A cookie is only a text file and cannot read data off your
      hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Cookies can track user
      traffic patterns, recognize your computer's browser when you return, and could
      provide personalized content without requiring sign-in.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. However, they may
      be required to use some of the web applications on the City's site.
    </p>
    <h1>Google Analytics Cookie Tracking</h1>
    <p>
      Some City applications use Google Analytics cookies to log user sessions and help
      us understand traffic and behavior. This helps us analyze data about web page traffic
      and improve our website in order to tailor it to customer needs. We only use this
      information for statistical analysis purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some City applications include the Google Analytics Display Advertising feature
      used to provide Demographics and Interest Reporting. This feature uses a third party
      DoubleClick Cookie.
    </p>
    <p>
      To provide website visitors the ability to prevent their data from being used by Google
      Analytics, Google has developed the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on for the
      Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js, analytics.js, dc.js). This add-on instructs the
      Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js, analytics.js, and dc.js) running on websites to
      prohibit sending information to Google Analytics. However, the Google Analytics opt-out
      browser add-on does not prevent data from being sent to the City's site. <br>
      Visit <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/</a>
      for more info on how to opt out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please note that updates to your browser or operating system may affect the functionality
      of the opt-out add-on. The latest versions of Internet Explorer sometimes load the Google
      Analytics opt-out add-on after sending data to Google Analytics. Therefore, if you are
      using Internet Explorer, the add-on will set cookies on your computer. These cookies
      ensure that any collected data is immediately deleted from the collection server. Please
      make sure that third party cookies aren't disabled for your Internet Explorer browser. If
      you delete your cookies, the add-on will, within a short timeframe, reset these cookies to
      ensure that your Google Analytics browser add-on remains fully functional.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following chart is a detailed list of Google Analytics cookies that would be used.

    <h1>Minor's Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
      Any information collected by any City site from children under 13 are subject
      to the same guidelines as the general City privacy policy. In addition, the
      following guidelines will be followed for any information collected by or for
      any child under 13:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Information that could be collected from or for a minor includes but might
        not be limited to name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, school,
        and hobbies.
      </li>
      <li>
        Parental (including legal guardian) Consent
      </li>
      <li>
        Parental consent will be obtained before collecting, using or disclosing
        personal information about a child.
      </li>
      <li>
        If any information practices
        change in a "material" way, new consent will
        be obtained from the parents. This includes changes in the kinds of material
        being collected, a change in how that information is being used, or if there
        is a change in the third parties that have access to that information.
      </li>
      <li>
        Parents will be able to review the personal information collected from their
        children which includes verification of the identity of the requesting parent.
        See individual requests for information for specifics.
      </li>
      <li>
        Parents will be allowed to revoke their consent and delete information collected
        from or for their children on request. When consent is revoked, the website
        will stop collecting, using or disclosing information from or for that child.
        Revocation may end a child's participation in an activity if the information
        collected was necessary for participation on the website.

    <h1>Security</h1>
    <p>
      The City of Los Angeles is committed to data security and the data quality of
      personally identifiable information that is either available from or collected
      by our website and has taken reasonable precautions to protect such information
      from loss, misuse or alteration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The City operates "secure data networks" protected by industry standard firewalls
      and password protection systems. Only authorized individuals have access to
      the information provided by our users.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a City application accepts credit cards or any other particularly sensitive
      information for any of its services, it encrypts all ordering information, such
      as your name and credit card number, in order to protect its confidentiality.
    </p>
    <h1>Access to Your Information</h1>
    <p>
      Unless otherwise prohibited by state or federal law, rule or regulation you
      will be granted the ability to access and correct any personally identifiable
      information. We will take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting
      access to review or make corrections to your information. Each City service that
      collects personally identifiable information will allow for review and update of
      that information. See individual requests for information for specifics.
    </p>
    <h1>Non City Websites</h1>
    <p>
      Non-city websites may be linked through the City's website. Many non-city
      sites may or may not be subject to the Public Records Act and may or may not
      be subject to other sections of California Code or federal law. Visitors to
      such sites are advised to check the privacy statements of such sites and to
      be cautious about providing personally identifiable information without a clear
      understanding of how the information will be used. Visitors may also wish to
      consult privacy guidelines such as those recommended by the Online Privacy Alliance
      (<a
